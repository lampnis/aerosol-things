# Description
Averaging standard $N=5$ FFT block size $< 1\ \text{s}$

## Bypass = 0
Bypass side needle valves turned to 'closed' position

## Bypass = 5
Bypass side needle valves turned n=5 turns open

## Bypass = 1000
Bypass side needle valves turned to 'fully open' position

## Bypass = 5 short
Short path, with second flowmeter to balance volume removed

## Bypass = 5 short redo
-"- but rechecking because there was doubt that cell needle valves may have been closed...

## Bypass = 5 short bigfilter
-"- but with additional big 3D printed Helmoltz filter

## Bypass = 5 short volume
-"- removed filter, but added additional volume for the "sample" part of the cell, s.t.
the sample and balance volumes would be ~ similar

## Bypass = 5 short volume O-closed
-"- but with output side of cell closed (big valve)

## Bypass = 5 short O-closed
-"- w/o volume or filter but output side of the cell closed
