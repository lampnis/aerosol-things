## Testing the leaks

1. w/o changes: for now the best (20 mbar/min)

2. w/ plug: worse (75 mbar/min)

3. w/ metal plug (2 screw plugs): instantly 1 atm after turning off the pump

Concept of automatic measurements:

1) Measurement time = (DFB max tune - DFB offset 1) * Meas Time [s]

2) Loop for repeating measurements:
	def auto_measurements(n_measurements):
		for i in range(n_measurements):
			change_file_name(f"measurement_{i}")
			measure = True
			if measure == False:
				GasX or clear_chart
				continue

Questions:
1) If cell is not leaking, what variable would we need to loop over? Current setup is good for leaky cell,
because it does GasX multiple times per one spectrum recording. But if cell is not leaking much, there is no
need for multiple GasX per one spectrum.

2) Is there a need for multiple spectra for averaging? As per my current understanding, that can be managed by increasing a single measurement (point) time.

Overall, more discussion is needed to understand the exact needs for this setup.

TODO: Testing the new logic -- fast flush ends when pressure is halfway to the target (if operations are fast enough)
conclusion: fast flush also needs a choke OR it must be controlled by state duration time (must be short enough)
Q: Should GasX state have pump on or off...

## Measuring n spectra

In measurement loop 12th step of the sequence
(follow the "Measure" button), wrap "Measure"
and "Measure w/ GasX" buttons into the case structure which would trigger repeating
measurements for n times. Kind of a for loop,
but not really.

How would work:

* set n
* current n
* start_offset = 300

* measure n: False
|__do regular measurement
   |__tune: False
      |__measure->False
      measure: False
      |__tune->False

* measure n: True
|__current n == set n
   |__change file name to '...{Mn}'
   |__regular measurement
   |__clear plot
   |__measure n == False
   current n < set n
   |__change file name to '...{Mn}'
   |__regular measurement
   |__offset = start_offset
   |__clear plot
   |__current n += 1

Automation is tested on non-GasX measurement.
TODO: test on "Measure w/ GasX" (tested, works)

slow evac is triggered correctly now (double check)

Added a tunable parameter, which defines the pressure where
fast flush stops.

Super fast (2 ms) loop wait does not allow stopping fast 
flush sooner than ~30 mbar before  target pressure.

1563 (0x61B) (112 mV) peak for single point testing.

Changed cont measure data and path default

!!!For single measurement, tune step=0 !!!

Added Gasx state string to fast sensor state trigger.

Trying to delay measurement data recording trigger
(state string) by introducing timeout before sending out
the state string.
Still problems with measurement.

Fixed timeout
Added timeout for pump in gasx.
For each measurement pressure still need to adjust gasx
parameters (fast pump stop at n mbar to target etc.)

Try to use pico AWG in labview instead of DAQ, to control laser current 

04.07.2025.

1) Added AWG inside already existing Pico subVI.

Description:

I need to change offset on every 'single' measurement, to achieve effective scan over spectrum.
Sequence would be

Change offset -> measure -> change offset -> measure ...

Problem is, that current pico loop is 1.00 [s] long, due to the necessary sampling requirements.

So need to find, where and how exactly the main program progresses through the 'single' measurements

'single' measurement

  AWG setting							     
----------------1[s]----------------

				    ----------------1[s]----------------

Need to insert monitoring option from CEPAS system to see what is the actual voltage that's being fed
into the laser. DONE (did with probes, w/o special soldered thing)

V_in is on the same order as expected!

Got to connect the signal to laser input. But that signal now seems even noisier than the gasera control board supplied one. So must find some source of noise or introduce some crazy filter!

17.07.2025.
Need to find where exactly measurement gets triggered. We cannot wait for just a value change of control, we need to wait for the actual changed value which we should somehow see from LDTC1020...
PROBLEM: labview speaks to picoscope and CEPAS board separately, no direct connection in between them.
BRUTE FORCE SOLUTION 1: make measurement stop after each single measurement
BRUTE FORCE SOLUTION 2: make timebase/sampling window temporally short (DRAWBACK: unreliable power meas.)
QUESTION: how would pico loop work, if timebase left default, and just change the loop time to shorter
ANSWER: probably breaks something...(not tested)

CANTILEVER TRACKING

INSIDE : OLD <30u mass no.
Old one is inside 'r6c9 soi2' bottom right corner

24.09.2025
Put back in old cantilever to see if it still has some leak like new one... 

Old cantilever reinstalled: reacts to voice in amplitude range 500u-1000m, some low-f noise visible more than with new CL

Lets see the new one again: flatter spectrum overall, external voice like acoustics can easier hit above 1m signal levels. Much less low-f noise

Trying R6C7: Foam helps for dampening environment sounds. Noise high level is ~150u-250u. At 600 Hz it starts to fall, and at 800 Hz
it is already fallen to around 50u or less

Trying R6C5: With avg N=1 situation is similar  as with other two new CLs. with N=10 noise floor rises to around 100-150u, and noise delta looks like some 75u, but reduction in that is expected as sqrt(N).

Old: Looks like expected.

R10C5: looks something like between new 30u and old 30u(?) cantilevers.

TODO: look at the paper plan DONE

R10C5: Looks better but low freq noise floor still a bit elevated, see saved spectrum. Testing with absorption signal.
