# Session Log

## 2025-10-30

### Session 1

*   Established the project's context and goals.
*   Created `GEMINI.md` to store project context for future sessions.
*   Processed the user's raw `notes.txt` file into a structured, summarized `WORKLOG.md`.
*   Established and executed a Git workflow to stage and commit the new documentation files (`GEMINI.md`, `WORKLOG.md`, `notes.txt`).
*   Diagnosed a `git push` failure caused by an SSH key passphrase prompt.
*   Planned the next step for the user to configure `ssh-agent` to enable automated pushes.
*   Created this `SESSIONS.md` file to log our interactions and progress.

### Session 2

*   Created the `additional-context` directory.
*   Moved `WORKLOG.md`, `SESSIONS.md`, and `notes.txt` into `additional-context/`.
*   Created `additional-context/TREE.md`.
*   Updated `GEMINI.md` with a new startup routine and `TREE.md` reference.
*   Staged, committed, and pushed all changes to the remote repository.
